# Epert-Advisor-from-mt4-to-mt5
Converting an Expert Advisor (EA) from MetaTrader 4 (MT4) to MetaTrader 5 (MT5) requires significant adjustments, as both platforms have distinct features, functions, and API structures. The most crucial aspects to address include differences in the way both platforms handle orders, order types, timeframes, and trading functions.

Here’s an outline of the general steps needed to convert your MT4 Expert Advisor (EA) code to MT5:
Key Differences Between MT4 and MT5:

    Order Execution:
        MT4 uses OrderSend() for placing orders, while MT5 uses OrderSendAsync() or OrderSend() with a different structure.
        MT5 uses Position rather than Orders for tracking open trades.
        MT4 has OrderSelect(), OrderClose(), while MT5 has PositionSelect(), PositionClose().

    Trade Functions:
        The syntax for OrderSend() in MT4 differs from MT5's approach to placing orders.
        In MT5, multiple order types (market, pending) and different account management functions must be considered.

    Indicators and Functions:
        MT4 uses custom indicator handling (like iCustom()), while MT5 uses slightly different syntax and approach for handling indicators and their values.

    Timeframes and Symbol Handling:
        MT5 supports more timeframes and instruments, but the handling of symbols and timeframes will need adjustments.

Basic Conversion Approach:

    Prepare Your MT4 EA:
        Familiarize yourself with the MT4 EA and identify all trade-related functions, indicators, and custom logic.

    Replace MT4 Functions with MT5 Alternatives:
        Replace order execution logic from OrderSend() with OrderSendAsync() or new functions in MT5.
        Change OrderSelect() and related order handling to PositionSelect() or PositionGet().
        Modify stop-loss, take-profit, and order filling processes according to MT5 requirements.

    Indicator Handling:
        Change indicator calls from iCustom() and other MT4 functions to their MT5 equivalents.

    Backtest and Debug:
        After conversion, thoroughly backtest the EA in MT5 using historical data.
        Adjust your logic for any unexpected behaviors.

Here is a basic example of the conversion for order management between MT4 and MT5:
Example of Order Management Code Conversion:
MT4 Example:

// Opening a market order in MT4
int ticket = OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, 0.1, Ask, 2, 0, 0, "Buy Order", 0, 0, Blue);
if(ticket < 0) {
    Print("Error opening order: ", ErrorDescription(GetLastError()));
} else {
    Print("Order opened with ticket: ", ticket);
}

MT5 Conversion:

// Opening a market order in MT5
MqlTradeRequest request = {};
MqlTradeResult result = {};

request.action = TRADE_ACTION_DEAL;
request.symbol = Symbol();
request.volume = 0.1;
request.price = Ask;
request.type = ORDER_TYPE_BUY;
request.sl = 0;
request.tp = 0;
request.deviation = 10;
request.magic = 123456;
request.comment = "Buy Order";

// Send the trade request
if(OrderSend(request, result)) {
    Print("Order opened successfully. Ticket: ", result.order);
} else {
    Print("Error opening order: ", GetLastError());
}

Steps for Full Conversion:

    Initialization (OnInit in MT4 to OnInit in MT5):
        Ensure that all initializations such as setting properties, parameters, etc., are compatible with MT5's syntax.

    MT4:

int OnInit() {
    // Initialize custom indicators, variables, etc.
    return(INIT_SUCCEEDED);
}

MT5:

    int OnInit() {
        // Initialize custom indicators, variables, etc.
        return(INIT_SUCCEEDED);
    }

    Order Management and Trading Functions:
        Adjust the OrderSend, OrderClose, OrderModify functions in MT4 to MT5-compatible equivalents.
        MT5 uses MqlTradeRequest and MqlTradeResult structures to manage orders.

    Handling Symbols and Timeframes:
        In MT4, symbols are accessed through Symbol() and timeframes with constants like Period(). In MT5, the same can be done using functions like Symbol() and PeriodSeconds().

    Modify Custom Indicators:
        Convert custom indicators and custom functions accordingly. MT5 may have slightly different ways of handling custom indicators.

    Event Handling:
        Event handling in MT5 (like OnTick() or OnTimer()) should be adapted from MT4's event-driven system.

    Debugging and Backtesting:
        After rewriting the code for MT5, ensure to backtest the Expert Advisor thoroughly in the MT5 Strategy Tester.

Example of Adapting a Simple Moving Average:
MT4:

// Simple Moving Average in MT4
double smaValue = iMA(Symbol(), 0, 14, 0, MODE_SMA, PRICE_CLOSE, 0);

MT5:

// Simple Moving Average in MT5
double smaValue = iMA(Symbol(), PERIOD_D1, 14, 0, MODE_SMA, PRICE_CLOSE, 0);

Complete Conversion Steps for 2400 Lines:

Converting 2400 lines of code will require:

    Comprehensive Review: Go through each line and evaluate how each function is handled in MT5.
    Modify Order Handling: As mentioned, adapt order functions to the MT5 structure.
    Debugging: Test small sections of the code first before converting the whole EA.
    Compatibility Testing: Ensure the EA runs well in MT5's Strategy Tester with all relevant symbols and timeframes.

Tool for Automated Conversion:

There is no official tool from MetaTrader to fully convert MT4 code to MT5, but MetaTrader’s MQL5 documentation and community forums are useful for understanding the differences. A third-party developer can help expedite the conversion if the code is large and complex.

Note: Given that the code is quite extensive (2400 lines), I recommend performing the conversion incrementally to ensure the integrity of the logic is preserved during the process.
To extend the Python code for performing the conversion incrementally, we'll take a modular and structured approach. This will ensure that the integrity of the logic is preserved while transitioning from MetaTrader 4 (MT4) to MetaTrader 5 (MT5).
High-Level Approach:

    Modular Code Structure: Break down the logic into smaller, independent functions or classes.
    Incremental Conversion: Convert one segment of the MT4 code at a time, verify it, and proceed step by step.
    Logging and Error Handling: Implement logging and error handling to track progress and ensure that any issues encountered during the conversion process are clearly identified.
    Backtesting and Verification: After converting each segment, test it with historical data (backtesting) to ensure the logic is preserved and works as expected.

Below is a Python-based solution to simulate an incremental conversion process. The code is organized into functions, and each function corresponds to a key section of the trading logic (order management, indicators, etc.).

We'll simulate the approach by writing functions for different parts of the Expert Advisor (EA) and then incrementally convert them.

Explanation of the Python Code:

    Logging: We use Python's built-in logging module to track each step of the conversion process. This helps in debugging and understanding which part of the conversion process is currently being executed.

    Helper Functions:
        check_mt4_to_mt5_conversion(): Simulates the process of checking if a specific MT4 function is converted correctly to MT5.
        convert_order_execution(): Simulates the conversion of the OrderSend() function from MT4 to MqlTradeRequest in MT5.
        convert_indicator_logic(): Simulates converting the iMA() function (Simple Moving Average) from MT4 to MT5.
        convert_order_closing(): Converts the OrderClose() function in MT4 to PositionClose() in MT5.

    Incremental Conversion: The functions are written to convert each section of the Expert Advisor (EA) code step-by-step. This includes the order execution, indicator logic, and order closing logic. Each conversion is verified with a mock check before proceeding to the next section.

    Main Function: The main function simulates running the entire conversion process. It performs the incremental conversion of different parts of the EA and logs the result.

    Backtesting: After the incremental conversion is complete, you would need to backtest the newly converted code using MT5's Strategy Tester to ensure the logic remains intact and works as expected.

Incremental Testing and Verification:

    Step-by-Step Conversion: You can focus on converting small parts of the code (such as order handling, indicator calls, etc.) and then test each part individually.
    Backtesting: After converting each segment of the EA, run backtests to ensure the logic is correct before moving to the next section.
    Error Handling: If any part of the code fails, review the logs to identify where the issue occurred and fix it before continuing.

Conclusion:

This approach allows you to convert an MT4 Expert Advisor to MT5 incrementally while ensuring that each part of the logic is intact. By modularizing the conversion process and using logs and backtesting, you can maintain the integrity of the EA's functionality as you transition from MT4 to MT5.
